            <h1>ABOUT CODEPREP</h1>
            <p>Are you new to programming? CODEPREP is just what you need to
            prepare and practice for the high stress dynamic of technical
            interviews. With our variety of sample questions, varying
            difficulty and integrated peer review elements, you are able to
            simulate whiteboarding with live feedback.</p>
            <p>Our application has a database full of questions with a variety of
            difficulties (easy, medium, hard). Upon selection, the user will be
            taken to a random question with a predetermined countdown clock. In
            the text form, and under time constraints, the user will write
            their solution or sudo-code. When time runs out, the user will no
            longer be able to edit their solution and they will be prompted to
            either submit their solution to the public or skip to the next
            question.</p>
            <p>Interviews are stressful, but CODEPREP is here to make
            it less miserable!</p>
